# (Work in progress) An overview of the Digital Forensics research literature

Systematic Literature Review of academic papers in Digital Forensics to give
an overview of various subareas in the field.

## TODO

* clean up old tags
* generate pretty graphs (and post them in this readme)
* review "contribution areas" tags for misclassifications.
* Write a "contribution" summary for every paper.
* Rename some tags and write explanations (since the semantics of some tags
  is non obvious and tend to drift through the process).
* More papers
* TODO include theses, books, standards and tools?

## Sources
* Digital Investigation: scopus (query: SRCTITLE({digital investigation})).
* IFIP wg11.9: manually go through each book: https://link.springer.com/conference/digitalforensics


more TODO:
* TODO DFRWS (I suspect not everything is published as special issues of Digital Investigation, especially older papers).
* TODO IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security
* TODO ARES WSDF?
* TODO IEEE International Workshop on Information Forensics and Security (WIFS)?
* TODO dead conferences
* TODO include papers from non-DF-specific journals and conferences? e.g. IEEE Access.
* TODO use citation graphs to find more venues (openalex, crossref, etc.)?
* TODO use keyword search or not?

## Process
1. Download all dois (or links) for a few select (reputable) venues.
1. Open one at a time and skim the title and abstract. If the abstract is
   ambiguous, skim the "conclusion"-section of the paper. If the conclusion is ambigious, skim rest of the paper.
1. Decide on tags/themes/keywords as we go. Hierarchically classify (i.e. do a
   rough classification first and then classify each subgroup in more detail, fix misclassifications as we go).
1. ???
1. profit.
